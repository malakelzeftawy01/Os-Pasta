            <p class="r2">This place has incredible pasta! I had the opportunity to stay on Zamelek for a few days and couldn't stop going here for pasta. All of them were excellent of the dishes I had. The best I would say was the Lankan(the red sauce with spiral noodles and chicken) . It had an excellent mixture of savory spices and aromas that I could not resist. For a more classic pasta, the spaghetti bolognese or the filet Verde(dark sauce fettuccine noodles) were also excellent choices. Also pictured is the Monsiuer Baehler (green suace, spiral noodles with calamari) and chicken rosemary. Those were also good choices especially the Monsiuer of you're into calamari. It seems that anything you order is excellent so please enjoy this incredible restaurant if you're anywhere near Cairo. </p>

            <p class="r1">Reviewed by 652malis Sep 17, 2019 Amazing and unique pasta</p>

            <p class="r2">O's pasta is just amazing. Totally unique pastas with the freshest ingredients, prepared by kind and welcoming people. The most interesting thing about it is that they use special Egyptian ingredients, such as freshly dried peppers and tomatoes, or fresh green peppercorns. The first night I had a pasta with shrimp, lemon, garlic, dried red pepper, and loads of parsley, it was bursting with flavor. The second night I had a pasta with beef, mushrooms, and green peppercorns, also delicious. It is a tiny place so it has a very cozy and warm atmosphere with good music. I was visiting Cairo for a few days and ate here twice. Soups are also excellent and while I did not try the salads they looked fresh and delightful. Several things on the menu are vegetarian as well, I want to go back and try one of the pesto pastas. In fact I want to try everything on the menu! FYI like many places in Cairo there is no alcohol, but try the lemon mint drink, it's really refreshing. </p>

            <p class="r1">Reviewed by SarinaA15, Feb 26, 2019, Hidden Cozy restaurant with quality Italian cuisine in Cairo</p>

            <p class="r2">First time we have found the restaurant was by chance while walking around Zamalek, as it is somewhat hidden from one's eye! If you spot it and enter inside, you will suddenly find yourself in a cozy place with lovely decorations, between tables arranged nicely in a small eatery. Good thing it that there is no smoking inside ( which is very rare in Cairo ), so you may enjoy your nice bowl of pasta with friends, family. The menu offers variety of different pasta, tortellini, and desserts. The pasta with dried fish eggs ( bottarga ) was amazing! Loved it. Fully recommend the place for a quality dining experience. </p>
